# train-scheduler
In this class assignment, the goal was to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various space ships, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
