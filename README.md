## Description
Train Scheduler is a basic train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data, in this case, for star ships in the Star Trek universe. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various star ships, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## How to Use
You are a Starfleet cadet studying at the Academy and it is your job to input new information of any ships entering San Francisco. 

Input the ship name, its final destination, its initial arrival time (HH:MM), and its frequency (in minutes). Once you submit, you will see the date of when that ship arrives as well as how many minutes away it is.
